    Tree
    1. A tree is a collection of nodes connected by directed (or undirected) edges.
    2. A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.
    3. The node at the top of the tree is called the root. If this node is connected by another node, the root is a parent node and the connected node is a child.
    4. A node with no children is called a leaf node.
    5. The maximum number of children a node can have is called the degree of the node.
    6. Following are the types of trees:
        - Binary Tree
        - Binary Search Tree
        - AVL Tree
        - Red-Black Tree
        - B-Tree
        - B+ Tree
        - Splay Tree
        - Segment Tree
        - K-D Tree
        - Trie
        - Suffix Tree
        - Suffix Array
